# CaKDP
(CVPR 2024) CaKDP: Category-aware Knowledge Distillation and Pruning Framework for Lightweight 3D Object Detection

# News
[2024/3/6]: Code release for KITTI results.

# Introduction
Our code is based on OpenPCDet v0.5.2 and SparseKD (https://github.com/CVMI-Lab/SparseKD). More updates on OpenPCDet are supposed to be compatible with our code.

# Installation
Please refer to INSTALL.md (https://github.com/zhnxjtu/CaKDP/blob/main/docs/INSTALL.md), SparseKD (https://github.com/CVMI-Lab/SparseKD) and OpenPCDet (https://github.com/open-mmlab/OpenPCDet) for the installation of OpenPCDet.

# Getting Started
Please refer to GETTING_STARTED.md(https://github.com/zhnxjtu/CaKDP/blob/main/docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) to learn more usage about this project.

# Acknowledgement
Our code is heavily based on OpenPCDet(https://github.com/open-mmlab/OpenPCDet) and SparseKD(https://github.com/CVMI-Lab/SparseKD). Thanks OpenPCDet Development Team and the team of SparseKD for their awesome codebase.

We also thank all reviewers and AC for their valuable comments.
